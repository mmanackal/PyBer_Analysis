# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
For this project, we were tasked with analyzing rideshare data for PyBer. We reviewed fares by city type, average fare by driver, rider count by city, etc.. Our final deliverables for PyBer CEO V.Isualize were
a summary report by city type and fares by city type and date. The data we provided should give the company some direction in where they need to focus their attention next. 

### Results:
Based on the table below, the urban areas have more drivers than riders and also has the lowest average fare. With more drivers present, there might be healthy competition driving prices lower. The other possibility
for lower fares could be that urban riders could be traveling shorter distances than their rural and suburban counter parts, attributing to lower fares. If we knew the total population for these cities, we can get
an idea about what % of residents utilized PyBer. Suburban and Rural areas appear to be underserved by PyBer and perhaps some investment could go into advertising in those areas.

In the date analysis we completed, it appears there is an increase in fares towards the end of February going into March. Urban areas continue the trend on certain dates between March and April. It would be worth
the effort for PyBer to look into why there are more riders and/or higher fare rates during the spikes. Are there events happening, which are drawing more people into these areas and/or forcing people to ride-share vs
driving themselves. The other months should be looked at as well to see if this trend occurs during other periods.

### Summary:

Its clear from the data that urban areas are oversaturated with drivers and some of them could be incentivized to provide service in rural and suburban areas since they have a shortage. PyBer should conduct a survey for their
riders by city to determine why they are opting into this service. This would help PyBer understand how to better meet the needs of the suburban and rural communities. They should also look into whether or not fares need to 
be leveled. The higher fares could be due to travel distance but its worth looking into, in order to see if pricing is a reason why fewer suburban and rural residents utilize PyBer. It might be helpful to look at the age of the riders.
If the urban usage is driven by a particular age group who are less present in suburban and urban areas, PyBer would need to tailor their marketing strategies for each group differently. There's a lot to infer and look into
with the analysis we conducted. We expect the CEO to come back with more data requests to delve into this further.
